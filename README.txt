# OpenStreetMaps
I investigated the Open Street Map data for Austin. This involved data cleaning and wrangling tasks that were performed using Python. The processed data was saved in json format and uploaded to MongoDB. In the final step, the "Node" and "Way" tables were queried to collect aggregate and spatial statistics on the dataset.
